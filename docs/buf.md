# Buf

## Buf Schema Registry

We rely on [Buf][buf-url] for protobuf hosting, documentation, and SDK
management. All we do as project maintainers is to create protobufs and push
them up to the [Buf Schema Registry][buf-schema-registry-url].

> Remote packages is the movement towards this promise. With remote packages,
> Buf will take your modules and Protobuf plugins, add a little elbow grease,
> and **generate full-serve packages for you to consume** just like any
> third-party library in your native programming language. This means **you
> don't have to worry** about Protobuf code generation at all - you can push
> modules to the BSR and install **code stubs generated from those modules**
> using dependency management tools like npm, go, mvn, and gradle.

You can find all SDKs for this server [here][buf-sdks-url].

### NodeJS

This NodeJS server itself relies on some SDKs that were remotely generated by
Buf, which we installed with:

```shell
npm config set @buf:registry  https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1/

npm install \
  @buf/kevinmichaelchen_react-email-server.bufbuild_connect-es@latest \
  @buf/kevinmichaelchen_react-email-server.bufbuild_es@latest
```
