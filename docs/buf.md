# Buf

## Buf Schema Registry

We rely on [Buf][buf-url] for protobuf hosting, documentation, and SDK
management.

All we do as project maintainers is to create protobufs and push them up to the
[Buf Schema Registry][buf-schema-registry-url].

From there, any client (in a growing list of supported programming languages)
can declare a dependency on our protos.

You can find all SDKs for this server [here][buf-sdks-url].

### NodeJS

This NodeJS server itself relies on some SDKs that were remotely generated by
Buf, which we installed with:

```shell
npm config set @buf:registry  https://buf.build/gen/npm/v1/

npm install \
  @buf/kevinmichaelchen_react-email-server.bufbuild_connect-es@latest \
  @buf/kevinmichaelchen_react-email-server.bufbuild_es@latest
```
